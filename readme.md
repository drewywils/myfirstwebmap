The title for my first web map is "Route from Home to Chamberlain Park." This home address is not where my family currently lives in Raleigh, it is just the house I grew up in, so there is no worry with me making the address public. I used to take this route on my bike all the time as a kid and teenage to go play pickup basketball with my friends, as well as the older NC State students. The route flows through the University Park neighborhood in Raleigh, NC, home to a mix of families and college students. At one point, the route winds around the famous historical Rose Garden in Raleigh. I was able to obtain the data for this webmap via Google Maps as well. I then converted the data from Google Maps to a gpx file, where then I also converted the data to a geoJson file. After this, I then saved the geoJson file as "route.js," where then it was saved in atom as "data/route.js". The data even loaded in the console log as well, yet when I open the browser the map will appear for a split second before disappearing.
